## 🚨 Problem Statement
Electronic waste is increasing rapidly, yet **many people do not recycle** due to:
- Lack of knowledge of where to dispose items  
- Confusion about which bin accepts which e-waste  
- Unawareness of the value of their waste  
- Lack of motivation or incentive  

**Challenge:** Build a **Smart E-Waste Bin System** that is:
- **Easy to find:** location-based bin discovery  
- **Easy to use:** simple, intuitive UI  
- **Transparent:** shows detected item and value  
- **Trustworthy:** explains system actions  
- **Rewarding:** incentivizes users to recycle

## 💡 Our Solution
**CRX** integrates **smart bins, AI-powered detection, gamification, and blockchain ledger** into a single ecosystem:
1. **Location-Based Bin Finder:** Quickly locate nearest compatible bins on interactive maps  
2. **AI-Powered Detection:** Multi-modal scanning (image, weight, size) with real-time classification and value estimation  
3. **Gamification & Rewards:** Points, badges, achievements, and environmental impact tracking  
4. **Admin Dashboard:** Monitor bins, optimize collection, and analyze user engagement  
5. **Blockchain Ledger (CRX Approach):** Every transaction (item deposit, reward allocation) is logged **on-chain**, ensuring **immutability, transparency, and trust**
